			<h1>Mayflower Descendants in the State of Georgia</h1>
			
			<p>Primary meeting location: Atlanta, GA with colonies in Savannah and Sea Island. The Georgia Society is regulated by its duly adopted by-laws and the by-laws of
			the General Society, Plymouth, MA.</p>
			
			<p>Our society was founded in 1929 by 30 charter members. As of now, we have an active membership of  320 members. Even though eighty percent of our members reside in
			Atlanta, we do have members throughout the State of Georgia. We have two meetings a year, April and November,  in Atlanta. The Colonies hold separate meetings.
			We publish a newsletter four times a year.</p>

			<h1>Benefits of Being a Member</h1>
			
			<p>Uphold the Mayflower heritage in the face of a rapidly changing world.<p>
			
			<p>The principles established when the Mayflower Compact was written in 1620 exemplify the democratic form of government upon which our U.S.
			Constitution is based. We need to highlight this heritage for our descendants as the schools drift further away from the early history of our
			country and the spiritual foundation of our country is further eroded by contemporary perspectives.</p>
			
			<p>Establish a friendship with others whose roots hark back to the Mayflower.</p>
			
			<p>Join us in April and November for our regularly scheduled meetings. Commit yourself to keeping our Mayflower Society strong and vital by joining our committees.</p>
			
			<p>Receive special privileges.</p>
			
			<p>The General Society of Mayflower Descendants, headquartered in Plymouth, MA, provides extensive genealogical and historical information.
			www.themayflowersociety.com Every third September members from all over the United States and Canada gather in Plymouth for special meetings and tours.
			Plimoth (sic.) Plantation welcomes Mayflower members at a special rate and provides a window into the past through its recreation of the original colony.
			See www.plimoth.org.</p>
			
			<p>Receive publications from both the General Society and the Georgia Society.</p>
			
			<p>The Mayflower Quarterly, published by General Society, provides a wealth of information about history, genealogy, and current activities of the various societies.
			The Georgia Society News letter provides information about our meetings held twice a year in Atlanta and covers  matters of interest to our members.</p>

			<h1>The Mayflower Compact</h1>
			
			<p>The original document is not known to exist today. The earliest copy of the text appeared in print in 1622 in 'Mourt's Relation.'
			"The earliest handwritten copy of the text was that by Governor Bradford in his history, 'Of Plimoth Plantation,' and was probably set down
			in his handwriting between 1630 and 1646. He did not list the signers, nor did he refer to the document as 'Compact' or 'Mayflower Compact.'"</p>
			
			<p>Before Coming to the New World, the Pilgrims lived in Leyden, Holland from 1608 to 1620. While there, they absorbed the liberating influences of Dutch society
			and shifted toward a more democratic form of self-governance.</p>
			
			<p>As the passengers aboard the Mayflower journeyed across the Atlantic, tensions arose among the three factions: the Separatists seeking religious freedom,
			the merchant-adventurers seeking their fortune, and the crew seeking their livelihood. It became apparent that if these passengers were to survive in an alien land,
			they needed to consent voluntarily to a cooperative form of government. Thus it was that <i>The Mayflower Compact</i> came into being and was signed by the adult male
			passengers in November, 1620. While the language of Shakespeare's day might seem quaint to us today, the spirit of democracy set forth in this famous document is
			timeless.</p>
