	<p>Our Society's main objectives:</p>

	<p>To perpetuate to a remote posterity of the memory of our Pilgrim Fathers. To maintain and defend the principle of civil
		and religious liberty as set forth in the Compact of the Mayflower, "For the Glorie of God and advancement of the Christian
		faith, and honor of our country."</p>

	<p>To cherish and maintain the ideals and institutions of American freedom, and to oppose any theories or actions that threaten
		their continuity. To transmit the spirit, the purity of purpose and steadfastness of will of the Pilgrim Fathers to those
		who shall come after us, and undiminished heritage of liberty and law. To perpetuate to remote posterity the memory of
		the Pilgrim Fathers. To maintain and defend the principle of civil and religious liberty. To authenticate, preserve and
		mark historical spots made memorable by Pilgrim association. To discover and publish original matter in regard to the Pilgrims
		together with existing data known only to antiquarians. To discover, record and publish the ancestry of the Pilgrims and
		the lines of all their posterity--past and present. To cooperate with the General Society of Mayflower Descendants and
		with the affiliated State Societies composing it, in united effort for furtherance of the ends aforesaid.</p>

	<p>The Society is organized exclusively for charitable and educational purposes by which means we further our heritage of freedom.</p>

	<p>The primary purpose of this web-site is to link the members of the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of Georgia
		with each other and those other web-sites that may enhance their further genealogical search for their Mayflower roots.</p>

	<p>To inform and guide any potential new members in the search and documentation of their lines of descent from the Pilgrims
		that arrived in this country aboard the Mayflower in 1620. In addition, we hope to encourage everyone with an interest
		in our Pilgrim forefathers to pursue that interest and learn more about their place in our country's history. The accurate
		portrayal of those historic events is a fundamental basis for our society's existence.</p>

	<p>Notwithstanding any statement of purposes or powers aforesaid, this organization shall not, except to an insubstantial degree,
		engage in any activities or exercise any powers that are not in furtherance of its specific and primary purpose.</p>
